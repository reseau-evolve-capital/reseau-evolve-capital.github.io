# Reseau evolve capital website

This repository contains the website for the Reseau Evolve Capital association.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (optional, but recommended)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reseau-evolve-capital/reseau-evolve-capital.github.io.git
cd reseau-evolve-capital.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install
# or without Make
npm install
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
make docker-dev
# or without Make
docker-compose up
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🛠 Development

### Available Commands

#### Using Make

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Development
make dev              # Start development server without Docker
make docker-dev       # Start development server with Docker
make serve-static     # Preview static export locally

# Building
make build-prod       # Build for production
make export-static    # Generate static files

# Deployment
make deploy-gh        # Deploy to GitHub Pages

# Utility
make lint            # Run linter
make clean           # Clean Docker resources
make purge           # Clean all build artifacts and dependencies
```

#### Using npm directly

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run deploy       # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### Docker Services

The project includes two Docker services:

1. **web**: Development server with hot-reloading
   - Port: 3000
   - Command: `npm run dev`

2. **preview**: Static file server for testing production builds
   - Port: 3001
   - Command: `npx serve -s`

## 📦 Building for Production

To generate a static export:

```bash
make export-static
# or without Make
npm run build
```

The static files will be generated in the `out` directory. A `.nojekyll` file is automatically created in the `out` directory to ensure proper deployment on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site is automatically configured for GitHub Pages deployment. To deploy:

1. Make sure your changes are committed and pushed
2. Run the deployment command:
```bash
make deploy-gh
# or without Make
npm run deploy
```

The deployment process will:
1. Generate a static export in the `out` directory
2. Create a `.nojekyll` file to bypass Jekyll processing
3. Push the contents to the `gh-pages` branch

### Manual Deployment

You can also manually deploy the static files from the `out` directory to any static file hosting service. Note that the `.nojekyll` file is only required for GitHub Pages deployment.

## 🔧 Configuration

- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind CSS configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker services configuration
- `Dockerfile`: Docker build configuration

write a function that will animate each element to mimic the movement of a stock chart. calculate the width and height of the screen and make each element animation start from X =0 to the over border of the screen. the final Y should be near the top of the screen as we will mimic a rising stock market. the animation should last arround 10 seconds for each element. the element can start their animation at different initial Y.
