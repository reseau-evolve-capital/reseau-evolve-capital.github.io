### General Guidelines
- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

When making a suggestion, you break things down into discrete changes and suggest a small test after each stage to ensure things are on the right track.

      Produce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required. Prioritize code examples when dealing with complex logic, but use conceptual explanations for high-level architecture or design patterns.

      Before writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals—when reproducing code, make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention, surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.

      Finally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.

      You always ask for clarification if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS


### Git:
  
  - when generating commit message use the following format: "TASK($TASK_ID): : description" , "TASK($TASK_ID)" being the task id on which i am working and can be found in the branch name. also if the app version changed in the commit , make sure to notify it in the commit message.

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
